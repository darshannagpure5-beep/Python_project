Fake News Headline Generator (Python + Tkinter)
This project is a simple GUI-based Python application that generates random “breaking news” headlines using the Tkinter library. Instead of printing output in the terminal, the program displays headlines dynamically on a graphical window when the user clicks a button.

The app uses predefined lists of celebrities, actions, objects, and places, and combines them using Python’s random module to create unique headlines each time. A label widget displays the generated headline, while buttons allow the user to generate new headlines or exit the application. When exiting, a thank-you message is printed in the terminal.

Key Features:
1. GUI built using Tkinter
2. Random headline generation using Python lists and random.choice()
3. Interactive buttons for generating headlines and exiting the app
4. Dynamic label updates to display results on screen
5. Beginner-friendly project for learning GUI development, functions, and event handling in Python

Tech Stack:
Python, Tkinter, Random module
